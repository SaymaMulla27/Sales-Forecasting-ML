# 📊 Sales Forecasting

**Sales forecasting using multiple models – Seasonal Naïve, Holt-Winters, ARIMA, SARIMA, and Linear Regression**

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to apply various quantitative methods—**Time Series Models** and **Causal Models**—to accurately forecast product sales.

---

## 📈 Approach

1. **Perform time series analysis** to understand trends, seasonality, and patterns in the data.
2. **Train multiple forecasting models** on the training dataset.
3. **Compare model performance** and select the best one for final forecasting on test data.

## 🛠️ Models Used

- **Seasonal Naïve Model**
- **Holt-Winters Model** (Triple Exponential Smoothing)
- **ARIMA Model**
- **Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA)**
- **Linear Regression Model**

---

## ✅ Conclusion

After evaluating all models, the **Linear Regression Model** outperformed the other time-series approaches for this dataset.

This suggests that:

- A **regression model** is more effective for datasets with a strong **linear trend** and **seasonality**.
- **Historical patterns** were consistent enough for a causal approach like regression to yield more accurate forecasts.

This result highlights the importance of exploring both time-series and regression-based models when approaching forecasting tasks.
